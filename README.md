# basic_sliding_mode_controller_lib
A basic sliding mode controllers' set uses Simulink's matlab function to simulate.
It's my pleasure to help you quickly understand and master sliding mode control.  

My project introduces the following sliding mode control:
* The most basic simple sliding mode control
* Equivalent sliding mode control
* Global sliding mode control
* Sliding mode control based on HJI theory
* Sliding mode control using hyperbolic tangent
* Sliding mode control based on linearized feedback
* Sliding mode control based on nominal model
* Sliding mode control based on reaching law
* Robust sliding mode control based on reaching law
* Continuous sliding mode control based on slow time-varying disturbance observer
* Terminal sliding mode
* Upper bound sliding mode control
* Adaptive sliding mode control
* Fuzzy adaptive sliding mode control

If any qeustion, i warmly welcome you to discuss with me by the email 3527623856@qq.com.
## Additional
I'll add explain documents one by one later, to introduce every basic sliding mode controller.
